        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            Hi, I am Ansh Pandey, a Varanasi native. I am a fresher, but I have basic knowledge in Java Development.
            As far as my qualification is concerned, I secured BTech graduation in Computer Science and Engineering
            from Babu Banarsi Das Institute Of Technology Ghaziabad, under Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam Technical University,
            Lucknow in 2022, and some certifications like Core Java Development from Smart Programming Mohali,
            and Computer System Security from IIT Kanpur during my graduation.
            About my strength, I’m flexible and adoptable towards my work and always keen to learn new things.
            I’m a hard worker and I work smart. With respect to weakness, shyness was the one I faced earlier
            and now I was able to overcome it with confidence and passion towards work.
            As I am a fresher, I have theoretical/coding knowledge, but I can do hard work for my organization,
            and I will put all my efforts for the good progress of my organization. Being punctual and sincere,
            I can finish the work given to me on time and try to fulfill all the needs of the company from me.<br>
